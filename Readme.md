[This comment](https://github.com/Ideabin/Ideabin/pull/13#issuecomment-109555585) made me look for an emoji cheat sheet, and I found one!

The only issue was that it loaded sloooooowly, and the search was wobbly, and the copy code used ZeroClipboard which in turn uses Flash and I have FlashBlock on and I didn't want to create a new rule to allow Flash for this site. Sad.

So I decided to waste 3 hours to get this site modded to suit my needs.

I've trimmed down the html and replaced the copy-to-clipboad code with a plain `select` function. So, you just click on an emoji's text and it gets selected, you then press `Ctrl+C` and it gets copied. Simple Shit.
